[#build-the-documentation-site]
== Build the Documentation site

The repository uses https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antora Playbooks] to locally or remotely build the AsciiDoc content into a static website.

[#prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

[#git]
==== git

You need git to get the source code of this repository. Run the command below to check whether git is installed on your machine.

[,console]

If you don't have git installed on your machine, download and install it for your operating system from the https://git-scm.com/downloads[git downloads] page.

[#node-js]
==== Node.js

Antora requires an active long term support (LTS) release of Node.js. Run the command below to check if you have Node.js installed, and which version. This command should return an https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/[active Node.js LTS version number]

[,console]
----
node -v
----

If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, install it, preferably via https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm]

[#clone-the-playbook-repository]
=== Clone the Playbook repository

Run the git command to clone this repository.

[,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/rancher/turtles-docs.git
----

[#install-node-modules]
=== Install node modules

Open a terminal at the root of the git repository. Run the command below.

[,console]
----
npm install
----

[#build-the-static-website]
=== Build the Static Website

You can use the `make` command to build the documentation site locally or remotely. The Makefile defines various tasks for building the site using different playbooks.

### Build the site locally using the GitHub Pages playbook:

To build the site locally using the GitHub Pages playbook, run the following command:

[,console]
----
make gh-pages
----

This will generate the static website using the `turtles-gh-pages-playbook.yml` playbook.

### Build the site remotely:

To build the site remotely using the remote playbook, run:

[,console]
----
make remote
----

This will use the `playbook-remote.yml` to generate the site remotely.

### Build the site using the development playbook:

For development purposes, you can build the site using the development playbook by running:

[,console]
----
make dev
----

This will use the `turtles-dev-playbook.yml` to generate the site with development settings.

### Clean up the build:

To remove the build and temporary directories, use the following command:

[,console]
----
make clean
----

This will delete the `build` and `tmp` directories.

### Preview the site locally:

To preview the site locally, use the `preview` task:

[,console]
----
make preview
----

This will serve the site locally, allowing you to view it in your browser.

### Watch for changes and rebuild:

To watch for changes in the content and rebuild the site automatically, use the `watch` task:

[,console]
----
make watch
----

This will watch the content and documentation files for changes, rebuild the site, and preview it with hot reload.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

To run the build process for continuous integration, use the `ci` task:

[,console]
----
make ci
----

This will run the build using the GitHub Pages playbook and the development playbook in sequence.

[#turtles-version-updates-across-docs]
== Turtles Version Updates Across Docs

This section explains how Turtles documentation versions are managed and updated when new releases are published.

[#automated-version-bumping]
=== Automated Version Bumping

The documentation repository automatically updates versions when a new Turtles release tag is pushed to the main repository. Here's how the process works:
The version bump process is triggered automatically when:

1. A new version tag (format: `v*`) is pushed to the rancher/turtles repository
2. The GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/publish-version.yaml` detects the tag and starts the process

[#what-gets-updated]
==== What Gets Updated

The automation updates several types of version references throughout the documentation:

* **GitHub URLs**: Raw GitHub links are updated from `refs/heads/main` to `refs/tags/v{version}`
* **Environment Variables**: `TURTLES_VERSION` values in code examples
* **Helm Commands**: Version flags in `helm install` commands
* **Component Tables**: Version references in component compatibility tables

[#version-replacement-tool]
==== Version Replacement Tool

The repository includes a custom Go tool at `tools/setexampleversion/main.go` that handles version replacements:

* **Configuration**: Uses `replace-rules.json` to define replacement patterns
* **Flexible Rules**: Each rule specifies a regex pattern and replacement template

Example usage:
[,console]
----
go run tools/setexampleversion/main.go -version=v0.21.0 \
  docs/v0.21/modules/en/pages/user/installation.adoc \
  docs/v0.21/modules/en/pages/user/clusterclass.adoc
----

[#manual-version-updates]
=== Manual Version Updates

For manual version updates or testing:

1. **Update the config**: Modify `replace-rules.json` if new replacement patterns are needed
2. **Run the tool**: Execute the version replacement tool with the desired version
3. **Review changes**: Check that all version references have been updated correctly
4. **Test locally**: Build and preview the documentation to ensure everything works

[#adding-new-version-patterns]
=== Adding New Version Patterns

When new version references are added to the documentation:

1. **Identify the pattern**: Find the exact text pattern that needs version replacement
2. **Add a rule**: Update `replace-rules.json` with a new replacement rule
3. **Test the rule**: Run the tool to verify the pattern matches correctly
4. **Document the change**: Update this README if the change affects the workflow

Example rule structure:
[,json]
----
{
  "name": "Description of what this rule updates",
  "pattern": "regex-pattern-to-match",
  "replacement": "replacement-template-with-%s-placeholder"
}
----
